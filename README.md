# Gradle Bodyguard

## What is this?

> *Complete blog post to come. Stay tunned!*

[Supply chain attacks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/725-bitcoin-stealing-apps-snuck-into-ruby-repository/) are a reality and the JVM ecosystem is not safe.

There are several tools out there that help developers from JVM-based languages to protect against supply chain attacks - like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), [DependencyCheck](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) - and others.

However, when talking particularly about Gradle projects things start to become a little more tricky, because (but not only) :

- We are insterested not only in the dependencies that our project declares, but also in the transitive ones (actually, transitive dependencies are the main attack vector here);

- Is quite common that Gradle projects - specially multi-module ones - manage dependencies either with [Project extension](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.ExtraPropertiesExtension.html) API or with [buildSrc](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#sec:build_sources). In these two cases, tools like Dependabot - which parses your Gradle files in order to figure out dependencies - get confused or eventually don't find the dependencies;

- Gradle plugins for such type of tools eventually are available, but this means another plugin in your Gradle build;

- OWASP DependencyCheck is quite trick to be used in Android projects.


`gradle-bodyguard` was born to tackle these issues. Written in Python and running as a CLI tool, it requires no additional plugins in your project and exercises your Gradle build - regardless your project layout - and learns about the dependencies that **Gradle already knows**, even the transitive ones.

`gradle-bodyguard` then matches these artifacts against [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) and outputs the results for you. In this way, you can learn (and automate around) when some dependency introduces a new disclosed [CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) in your build, particularly at CI level.

Because OSSIndex is free to use, this tool was possible to be made. ðŸ˜Ž

## Setup

Install with [pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp). Requires Python 3.8.+ or newer.

```
â†’ pip install gradle-bodyguard
```

## Using

The most basic usage takes only a path to the target Gradle project you want to examine:

```
â†’ gradle-bodyguard -p <path-to-gradle-project>
```

You should see results in your terminal screen ðŸ”¥

You also can have a `json` version of the security report. This file is only generated when the tool find potential vulnerabilities :

```
â†’ gradle-bodyguard -p <path-to-gradle-project> -d <path-to-folder>
```

The `gradle-bodyguard-report.json` file will be stored at `folder`

If you realise that some CVEs actually don't impact your project at all, you can just ignore them and exclude such CVEs from the results

```
â†’ gradle-bodyguard -p <path-to-gradle-project> -i <CVE-ID>,<CVE-ID>,<CVE-ID>
```

See usage for a full list of options

```
â†’ gradle-bodyguard --help
```

## Using as a Github Action

Coming soon ðŸ”¥

## Limitations

As mentioned previously, `gradle-bodyguard` is backed by the amazing [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/), offered by [Sonatype](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/). If you were not aware of this product until now, you should have a look.

One limitation that `gradle-bodyguard` has is the following : this tool does not require your OSS Index `API TOKEN` for [authenticated REST API calls](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/doc/rest); **bodyguard** avoids that by batching the dependencies computed in the Gradle project and querying 125 Maven coordinates per HTTP request - since this option is [available at all](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/rest#/Component%20vulnerability%20reports/post).

This should work fine for most of small/medium projects out there(up to 500 dependencies including the transitive ones), and therefore the usage of the tool is a bit simpler as well.

If your project consumes way more dependencies than aforementioned and you started to see `429s` in logs, you must then provide your API_TOKEN

```
â†’ gradle-bodyguard --project my-project --token my-ossindex-api-token
```

## Practical Experiment using Android open-source apps

Do you want to learn how `gradle-bodyguard` can help you to fight back against supply-chain attacks?

## Credits

I'd like to thank in special :

- [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) because it allowed a newcomer in the Python ecosystem to build and ship his first package on Pypi with an amazing developer experience
- [Sonatype](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) for providing OSSIndex (and its companion REST API) for free to the open-source community
