# Google Services Gradle Plugin

This plugin converts the google-services.json file for Firebase into a set of resources that the Firebase libraries can use. It also references the strict-version-matcher plugin, and will execute those checks as well.

## Usage

### Plugins DSL

Add the following to your project's settings.gradle:

```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        google()
    }
}
```

Apply the plugin in your app's build.gradle:

```
plugins {
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services' version '4.3.2'
}
```

## Legacy way

Add the following to your buildscript classpath, obtained from Googleâ€™s
[Maven repository](//developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies#google-maven):

```
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.2'
```

Apply the plugin in your app's build.gradle:

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```
