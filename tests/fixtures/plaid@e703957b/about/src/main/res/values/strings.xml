    <string name="about_plaid_0">Plaid is a source of design news &amp; inspiration that serves as a concrete example of [material design principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles). Plaid pulls data from [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) &amp; [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/); it is in no way an official client for these services nor endorsed by them. It is rather good&#160;though.</string>
