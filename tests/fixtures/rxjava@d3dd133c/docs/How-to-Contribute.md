RxJava is still a work in progress and has a long list of work documented in the [Issues](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues).


If you wish to contribute we would ask that you:
- read [Rx Design Guidelines](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/10/28/rx-design-guidelines.aspx)
- review existing code and comply with existing patterns and idioms
- include unit tests
- stick to Rx contracts as defined by the Rx.Net implementation when porting operators (each issue attempts to reference the correct documentation from MSDN)

Information about licensing can be found at: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/2.x/CONTRIBUTING.md).
